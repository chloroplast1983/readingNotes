Business analysis is the practice of enabling change in an enterprise by defining needs and recommending solutions that deliver value to stakeholders. Business analysis enables an enterprise to articulate needs and the rationale for change, and to design and describe solutions that can deliver value.

to understand the current state, to define the future state, and to determine the activities required to move from the current to the future state.

### 1.3 

The activities that business analysts perform include

* understanding enterprise problems and goals
* analyzing needs and solutions
* devising strategies,
* driving change, and
* facilitating stakeholder collaboration.

## 2. Business Analysis Key Concepts

6 core concept:

* Change
* Need
* Solution
* Stakeholder
* Value
* Context

### 2.1 The Business Analysis Core Concept Model

#### Change

The act of transformation in response to a need.

Change works to improve the performance of an enterprise. These improvements are deliberate and controlled through business analysis activities.

#### Need

A problem or opportunity to be addressed.

Needs can cause changes by motivating stakeholders to act. Changes can also cause needs by eroding or enhancing the value delivered by existing solutions.

#### Solution

A specific way of satisfying one or more needs in a context.

A solution satisfies a need by resolving a problem faced by stakeholders or enabling stakeholders to take advantage of an opportunity.

#### Stakeholder

A group or individual with a relationship to the change, the need, or the solution.

Stakeholders are often defined in terms of interest in, impact on, and influence over the change. Stakeholders are grouped based on their relationship to the needs, changes, and solutions.

#### Value

The worth, importance, or usefulness of something to a stakeholder within a context.

Value can be seen as potential or realized returns, gains, and improvements. It is also possible to have a decrease in value in the form of losses, risks, and costs.

Value can be tangible or intangible. Tangible value is directly measurable. Tangible value often has a significant monetary component. Intangible value is measured indirectly. Intangible value often has a significant motivational component, such as a company's reputation or employee morale.
In some cases, value can be assessed in absolute terms, but in many cases is assessed in relative terms: one solution option is more valuable than another from the perspective of a given set of stakeholders.

#### context 

The circumstances that influence, are influenced by, and provide understanding of the change.
Changes occur within a context. The context is everything relevant to the change that is within the environment. Context may include attitudes, behaviours, beliefs, competitors, culture, demographics, goals, governments, infrastructure, languages, losses, processes, products, projects, sales, seasons, terminology, technology, weather, and any other element meeting the definition.

### 2.2 KeyTerms

#### Design

Design focuses on understanding how value might be realized by a solution if it is built

#### Enterprise

#### Organization

#### Plan

A plan is a proposal for doing or achieving something. Plans describe a set of events, the dependencies among the events, the expected sequence, the schedule, the results or outcomes, the materials and resources needed, and the stakeholders involved.

#### Requirement

Requirements focus on understanding what kind of value could be delivered if a requirement is fulfilled

#### Risk

Risk is the effect of uncertainty on the value of a change, a solution, or the enterprise.

### 2.3 Requirements Classification Schema

#### Business requirements

statements of goals, objectives, and outcomes that describe why a change has been initiated. They can apply to the whole of an enterprise, a business area, or a specific initiative.

#### Stakeholder requirements

describe the needs of stakeholders that must be met in order to achieve the business requirements. They may serve as a bridge between business and solution requirements.

#### Solution requirements

escribe the capabilities and qualities of a solution that meets the stakeholder requirements. They provide the appropriate level of detail to allow for the development and implementation of the solution. Solution requirements can be divided into two sub-categories:

* functional requirements
* non-functional requirements or quality of service requirements

#### Transition requirements

describe the capabilities that the solution must have and the conditions the solution must meet to facilitate transition from the current state to the future state, but which are not needed once the change is complete. They are differentiated from other requirements types because they are of a temporary nature. Transition requirements address topics such as data conversion, training, and business continuity.

### 2.4 Stakeholders

* business analyst
* customer
* domain subject matter expert
* end user
* implementation subject matter expert
* operational support
* project manager

### 2.5 Requirements and Designs

Requirements are focused on the need; designs are focused on the solution.
